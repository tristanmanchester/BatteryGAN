Enhancing Synthetic X-ray Microtomography Data for Battery Cathode Segmentation via Unpaired Generative Adversarial Networks1. Introduction1.1. Problem Statement: The Domain Gap in Tomography-Based SegmentationDeep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown remarkable success in semantic segmentation tasks across various domains. However, their application to the analysis of complex scientific imaging data, such as X-ray microtomography (µCT), faces a significant hurdle: the requirement for large datasets with pixel-accurate annotations.1 Manually segmenting 3D µCT volumes, especially those depicting intricate microstructures like solid-state battery electrodes, is an exceptionally laborious, time-consuming, and potentially subjective process.2 This bottleneck hinders the high-throughput analysis necessary for accelerating materials discovery and understanding structure-property relationships.3A viable strategy to circumvent the manual annotation bottleneck is the algorithmic generation of synthetic µCT data, where segmentation labels can be created concomitantly with the structural data [User Query]. This approach allows for the creation of large, perfectly labeled datasets suitable for training segmentation models. The specific context under consideration involves µCT data of solid-state battery cathodes, composed of Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) active material particles embedded within an argyrodite solid electrolyte matrix, acquired at a synchrotron beamline [User Query]. Synchrotron X-ray sources provide high photon flux, enabling rapid acquisition and high spatial resolution, which is advantageous for capturing fine microstructural details and dynamic processes.5 However, this rapid acquisition can sometimes come at the cost of image quality, potentially introducing higher noise levels or specific imaging artifacts compared to slower laboratory-based scans.6The core challenge arises from the inherent differences between the algorithmically generated synthetic data and the real-world data acquired from the synchrotron µCT experiments. The synthetic data, while structurally similar, often lacks the characteristic noise patterns, artifacts (e.g., beam hardening, phase contrast effects, detector imperfections), and subtle intensity variations present in the real images. This discrepancy, known as the "domain gap," significantly degrades the performance of segmentation models trained purely on synthetic data when they are applied to real experimental data.1 The model fails to generalize because it has not learned to recognize material phases under the diverse and often lower-quality conditions of the real imaging domain.1.2. Proposed Solution: GAN-Based Synthetic-to-Real Domain AdaptationGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as exceptionally powerful deep learning tools for generating realistic images and performing complex image transformations.16 One promising application is image-to-image translation, where a GAN learns to transform images from a source domain to mimic the style and characteristics of a target domain.18 This report investigates the use of GANs, particularly architectures designed for unpaired image-to-image translation like CycleGAN 16, to address the domain gap identified above.The central hypothesis is that such a GAN can be trained to "refine" the synthetic µCT data, translating its appearance to statistically resemble the real synchrotron µCT data. This involves learning to introduce realistic noise profiles and imaging artifacts characteristic of the synchrotron beamline, effectively making the synthetic data a more faithful representation of the target domain for the purpose of training a segmentation model.1However, a critical constraint underpins this approach: the GAN-based translation must preserve the underlying spatial structure and geometric integrity of the synthetic data with very high fidelity [User Query]. The primary value of the synthetic data lies in its associated ground-truth labels. If the GAN translation distorts the shapes, sizes, or locations of the NMC particles, argyrodite matrix, or pore spaces, the original labels will become invalid, rendering the entire process ineffective for training an accurate segmentation model.Therefore, the objective of this report is to provide an expert assessment of the feasibility of employing GANs for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in the context of synchrotron µCT data of battery cathodes. This includes evaluating suitable GAN architectures, analyzing techniques for ensuring structural fidelity, reviewing relevant prior work, discussing implementation and evaluation strategies, identifying potential challenges, and exploring alternative approaches. The goal is to determine if GANs can effectively bridge the domain gap while rigorously maintaining the validity of the synthetic segmentation labels.2. Generative Adversarial Networks for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation2.1. Fundamentals of GANs and Image-to-Image TranslationGANs operate based on a competitive process between two neural networks: a Generator (G) and a Discriminator (D).16 The Generator attempts to create synthetic data (e.g., images) that mimics a real data distribution, while the Discriminator attempts to distinguish between real samples from the dataset and fake samples produced by the Generator. Through this adversarial training, the Generator becomes progressively better at producing realistic outputs, while the Discriminator becomes more adept at detecting fakes.Image-to-Image (I2I) translation is a specific application within computer vision and graphics that focuses on learning a mapping to transform an input image from a source domain (X) to a target domain (Y), ideally preserving the essential content of the source image while adopting the stylistic characteristics of the target domain.18 I2I translation methods can be broadly categorized based on the nature of the training data:
Supervised I2I Translation: Requires paired training data, where each image in the source domain has a corresponding ground-truth image in the target domain (e.g., Pix2Pix 23). This is often impractical or impossible to obtain for many scientific imaging tasks, including the current scenario.18
Unsupervised I2I Translation: Operates on unpaired datasets, meaning there is no direct correspondence between individual images in the source and target domains.18 These methods learn the mapping by comparing the distributions of images in both domains.
Given the stochastic nature of microstructure formation and the inherent variations in experimental imaging, obtaining perfectly paired synthetic and real µCT volumes of identical battery cathode structures is infeasible. Therefore, unsupervised I2I translation methods are necessary for the proposed synthetic-to-real adaptation task.162.2. Unpaired Translation Architectures: CycleGAN and VariantsSeveral architectures have been developed for unsupervised I2I translation. Among the most prominent and relevant are:

CycleGAN: Introduced by Zhu et al. 19, CycleGAN is a seminal work in unpaired I2I translation and serves as a strong baseline. Its architecture consists of two generator networks (GX→Y​ and GY→X​) and two discriminator networks (DX​ and DY​).16

Adversarial Loss: Each generator is trained to produce images that can fool the corresponding discriminator in the target domain. For instance, GX→Y​ tries to generate images GX→Y​(x) (where x is from domain X) that DY​ classifies as real images from domain Y. This loss encourages the generated images to match the target domain's style and texture distribution.20 The standard GAN loss is typically formulated as:
$$ \mathcal{L}{GAN}(G{X \rightarrow Y}, D_Y, X, Y) = \mathbb{E}{y \sim p{data}(y)}[\log D_Y(y)] + \mathbb{E}{x \sim p{data}(x)}[\log(1 - D_Y(G_{X \rightarrow Y}(x)))] $$
A similar loss exists for GY→X​ and DX​.
Cycle-Consistency Loss: This is the key innovation of CycleGAN. It enforces the structural constraint that translating an image from domain X to domain Y and then back to domain X should ideally recover the original image, and vice versa.12 This is typically implemented using an L1 or L2 norm:
$$ \mathcal{L}{cyc}(G{X \rightarrow Y}, G_{Y \rightarrow X}) = \mathbb{E}{x \sim p{data}(x)}[| G_{Y \rightarrow X}(G_{X \rightarrow Y}(x)) - x |_1] + \mathbb{E}{y \sim p{data}(y)}[| G_{X \rightarrow Y}(G_{Y \rightarrow X}(y)) - y |_1] $$
This loss implicitly encourages the generators to preserve the content and structure of the input image during translation.16 CycleGAN has been widely applied in medical image synthesis, translating between modalities like CT, MRI, and ultrasound 16, as well as other domain adaptation tasks like stain transfer 33, denoising 34, and bridging simulation-to-reality gaps.1



UNIT (UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation Networks): This framework often utilizes Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in conjunction with GANs. It assumes a shared latent space between the two domains, enabling translation by encoding an image from one domain into the shared space and then decoding it into the other domain. While powerful, direct evidence for its application in tomography or materials science was less prevalent in the reviewed materials compared to CycleGAN.


MUNIT (Multimodal UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation Networks): MUNIT explicitly disentangles the content representation (domain-invariant) from the style representation (domain-specific). This allows for generating multiple diverse outputs (multimodal translation) for a single input image by sampling different style codes. However, some studies suggest MUNIT might struggle with preserving image content compared to other methods 18, which could be a concern for the label-fidelity requirement.


Other Variants: The field has seen numerous extensions and modifications to the basic CycleGAN framework. These include incorporating attention mechanisms to focus translation on relevant regions (AttentionGAN 39, A-CycleGAN 30), integrating feature extractors to better preserve details (CycleGAN+FE 17), using semantic guidance 16, or developing specialized loss functions for improved stability or handling large domain gaps.12

2.3. Suitability for Synthetic-to-Real Tomography DataUnpaired I2I translation methods, particularly CycleGAN and its derivatives, are conceptually well-suited for the task of refining synthetic µCT data. The core challenge stems from the absence of perfectly matched pairs of synthetic and real microstructures, making supervised methods inapplicable. Unpaired methods directly address this by learning the mapping based on the overall distributions of the two domains.The specific task of synthetic-to-real translation is a common and successful application area for these models.1 The underlying assumption is that the fundamental physical structures represented in the synthetic data (NMC particles, argyrodite matrix, pores) also exist in the real data, but their visual appearance differs due to the physics of the synchrotron imaging process, noise characteristics, and the presence of various artifacts. The GAN's role is not to invent new structures but rather to learn the complex transformation function that modifies the appearance or rendering of the synthetic structures to match the style observed in the real synchrotron data. This includes introducing appropriate noise levels, contrast adjustments, and characteristic artifacts, thereby bridging the domain gap. The success of this approach hinges on the ability of the GAN to learn this stylistic transformation without compromising the structural integrity required for the segmentation labels to remain valid.3. Ensuring Structural and Semantic Fidelity during TranslationWhile unpaired I2I translation models like CycleGAN offer a promising avenue for domain adaptation, ensuring that the translation preserves the structural and semantic content of the source image with high fidelity is paramount, especially when downstream tasks like segmentation rely on the integrity of associated labels. Several techniques, ranging from inherent components of the models to specialized loss functions and architectural modifications, aim to achieve this.3.1. The Baseline: Cycle-Consistency LossThe cycle-consistency loss, integral to the CycleGAN framework, provides the foundational constraint for structural preservation.16 By penalizing deviations when an image is translated to the target domain and back (X→Y→X), it implicitly encourages the generator mappings (GX→Y​ and GY→X​) to be approximate inverses of each other, thereby limiting drastic alterations to the image content.27However, relying solely on cycle-consistency has limitations. As a pixel-level (or sometimes feature-level) constraint, it can be simultaneously too strict and too loose.12 It might prevent necessary stylistic changes required for realism or, conversely, fail to prevent subtle geometric distortions, texture alterations, or semantic inconsistencies that could invalidate segmentation labels.21 Studies have shown that CycleGAN alone can struggle to preserve semantic information accurately or avoid introducing unwanted geometric changes, particularly when the domains differ significantly or complex transformations are required.123.2. Identity LossIdentity loss is an additional regularization term often used in CycleGAN training.20 It encourages a generator to produce minimal change when given an image from its target domain as input. For the synthetic-to-real generator (GSynth→Real​), this typically means minimizing the difference between a real image y and its translation GSynth→Real​(y). Mathematically:Lidentity​(GSynth→Real​,Y)=Ey∼pdata​(y)​A similar loss can be applied to GReal→Synth​ using synthetic images x.The primary purpose is often to preserve characteristics like color composition when the generator should mainly be changing texture or style. In the context of synthetic-to-real translation, its direct benefit for preserving the synthetic structure during the Synth→Real mapping is less obvious, but it can help stabilize training and prevent the generator from making gratuitous changes, indirectly contributing to structural preservation.33 Some variations exist, such as focusing the identity loss on background regions to preserve them while allowing changes in the foreground.20 Adding identity loss was found beneficial in stain transfer applications.333.3. Advanced Techniques for FidelityRecognizing the limitations of basic cycle-consistency and identity losses, researchers have developed more sophisticated techniques to enforce structural and semantic fidelity:

Perceptual Loss: Instead of comparing raw pixel values (like L1 or L2 loss), perceptual loss measures the difference between high-level feature representations of the generated and target images.29 These features are typically extracted from intermediate layers of a pre-trained deep neural network, such as VGG, or sometimes even from the GAN's own discriminator.29 By minimizing the distance in this feature space, the loss encourages perceptual similarity, focusing on content and style rather than exact pixel matches. This often leads to sharper images with better preservation of textures and fine structural details compared to models trained only with pixel-wise losses.29 In the context of generating synthetic CT from MRI, incorporating perceptual loss into CycleGAN resulted in superior performance compared to U-Net (trained with L1 loss) in terms of error metrics (MAE, RMSE) and similarity metrics (PSNR, SSIM), especially for complex anatomical regions. It also led to more accurate dose estimations for radiotherapy planning, indicating improved structural fidelity.29 For the battery µCT data, perceptual loss could help maintain the characteristic textures of the NMC particles and argyrodite matrix, preserving boundary integrity crucial for segmentation.


Semantic Consistency Loss: This technique directly targets the preservation of semantic content during translation by incorporating knowledge from a segmentation network.16 The core idea is to penalize the generator if the semantic interpretation (i.e., the segmentation map or features extracted by a segmentation model) of the translated image differs significantly from that of the original image. The loss is often calculated as the difference (e.g., L1 or L2 norm, cross-entropy) between the segmentation outputs or intermediate features produced by applying a (potentially pre-trained) segmentation network to both the input image x and the translated image GX→Y​(x).26 Some approaches use segmentation models as additional "semantic discriminators" within the GAN framework.16 This method directly enforces that critical objects and labeled regions (like NMC particles, argyrodite, pores) remain identifiable and spatially consistent after translation.26 This makes it arguably the most relevant technique for ensuring the validity of the original segmentation labels post-translation. Implementation typically requires a segmentation model capable of processing images from at least the source (synthetic) domain, and ideally robust enough to handle both domains.


Attention Mechanisms: Attention modules integrated into the generator and/or discriminator architectures allow the network to selectively focus on important regions of the image while potentially leaving less relevant areas (e.g., background) unchanged.39 AttentionGAN, for example, explicitly generates attention masks to guide the translation process, aiming to identify discriminative foreground objects and minimize changes elsewhere.39 A-CycleGAN combined attention mechanisms with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for improved MR-to-CT translation.30 By concentrating the style transfer or artifact simulation effects on specific regions (e.g., the solid material phases), attention could potentially help preserve the structure of other regions (e.g., pores) or prevent the GAN from making global, structure-altering changes. Studies have reported improved performance over standard CycleGAN using attention-based methods.30


Feature Extraction Integration: Some approaches enhance GAN architectures by explicitly integrating feature extractor modules designed to capture and retain fine details that might be lost during the standard generation process.17 The CycleGAN+FE model demonstrated superior performance in MRI synthesis from CT by using such an extractor to improve image fidelity.23 This could be beneficial for maintaining the sharpness of particle boundaries or preserving subtle internal features within the NMC particles or argyrodite matrix.


Structural Similarity Metrics (e.g., SSIM): The Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is a metric designed to quantify image similarity based on perceived changes in structural information, luminance, and contrast. Unlike pixel-wise losses (L1/L2), SSIM is more sensitive to structural distortions. It can be incorporated directly into the GAN's loss function to explicitly optimize for structural preservation.32 The DC-cycleGAN model integrated SSIM alongside other losses for medical image synthesis.32 This provides a direct, quantifiable way to encourage the generator to maintain structural characteristics during translation.

3.4. Analysis of Effectiveness for Label AlignmentChoosing the most effective technique or combination of techniques for preserving label alignment requires careful consideration. Basic cycle-consistency provides a starting point but is often insufficient for complex tasks or stringent fidelity requirements.12
Semantic consistency loss offers the most direct mechanism for enforcing label preservation, as it explicitly penalizes changes in the semantic content identified by a segmentation network.26 This aligns perfectly with the user's primary constraint. However, it introduces additional complexity, requiring a reliable segmentation network for guidance and potentially increasing training time.
Perceptual loss indirectly aids label alignment by promoting better preservation of fine structures and textures, which are often crucial for accurate segmentation.29 It is generally less complex to implement than semantic consistency if using standard pre-trained networks like VGG.
Attention mechanisms 30 and feature extractors 17 aim to improve fidelity by focusing the translation or explicitly retaining details, which can indirectly benefit label preservation. Their effectiveness may depend on whether the important structural features align with what the attention or feature extraction modules prioritize.
Identity loss 33 and SSIM loss 32 act as valuable regularizers, discouraging unnecessary changes and explicitly promoting structural similarity, respectively. They can complement other loss terms.
Ultimately, there is often a trade-off between the directness of the constraint (semantic loss being most direct for labels) and implementation complexity. The optimal approach might involve combining multiple techniques. For instance, using CycleGAN with both semantic consistency loss (for direct label preservation) and perceptual loss (for visual quality and fine structure) could be a powerful strategy, albeit a complex one to tune due to the need to balance multiple loss terms.27 Empirical evaluation, particularly assessing the impact on downstream segmentation performance (Section 6.3), will be crucial to determine the most effective method for this specific application.The following table summarizes these techniques:Table 1: Comparison of Fidelity Preservation Techniques in Unpaired I2I Translation

4. GAN Applications in Tomography and Materials Science ImagingThe use of GANs for image synthesis and domain adaptation is well-established in medical imaging and is increasingly finding applications in materials science, including the analysis of µCT data. Understanding these precedents provides valuable context for the proposed task.4.1. Lessons from Medical Image Synthesis (CT/MRI)A significant body of work exists on using GANs, particularly CycleGAN and its variants, for synthesizing one medical imaging modality from another, often using unpaired data. Common examples include:
Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI for applications like MR-guided radiotherapy planning.16
Generating synthetic MRI from CT.17
Generating synthetic Ultrasound from CT.16
Image denoising and quality enhancement.34
Data augmentation to increase dataset size and variability.28
Key findings from this domain are highly relevant:
Feasibility: Unpaired GANs can successfully learn cross-modality mappings and generate visually realistic synthetic images.16
Architecture Choice: CycleGAN is a frequent choice due to its effectiveness with unpaired data.16 U-Net architectures are often used for the generators, leveraging their ability to capture fine details.29
Fidelity Enhancement: Techniques beyond basic CycleGAN, such as perceptual loss 29, semantic discriminators/consistency 16, attention mechanisms 30, and feature extractors 23, are often employed to improve image quality and structural preservation.
Evaluation: Evaluation typically combines quantitative metrics (MAE, PSNR, SSIM) 23, qualitative assessment by domain experts (e.g., physicians rating realism) 28, and assessment of downstream task performance (e.g., accuracy of dose calculations based on sCT 29, cell detection accuracy 34).
4.2. Applications in X-ray Microtomography and Materials ScienceX-ray microtomography (µCT) is a cornerstone technique in materials science, enabling non-destructive 3D visualization of internal microstructures in diverse materials like composites, porous media, geological samples, and battery components.3 Synchrotron-based µCT offers advantages in speed and resolution but can introduce unique image characteristics, including noise from fast acquisitions.3Deep learning, including GANs, is increasingly being applied to process and analyze µCT data in materials science:
Segmentation: CNNs, particularly U-Net architectures, are used to segment complex multiphase microstructures from µCT images, often outperforming traditional thresholding or watershed methods. However, training these models typically requires substantial manually labeled data, motivating research into semi-supervised or unsupervised approaches.2
Image Enhancement and Super-Resolution: GANs, sometimes incorporating elements from models like ESRGAN or CycleGAN, have been used to improve the quality of µCT images by enhancing resolution, reducing noise, or improving contrast, aiding in the identification of fine features like fiber boundaries or voids.42
Microstructure Generation and Inpainting: GANs are employed to generate statistically representative virtual microstructures based on experimental data, useful for simulations or creating larger datasets.42 SliceGAN, for instance, can generate 3D volumes from 2D slices under assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy.49 GANs have also been used for inpainting, filling in missing or corrupted regions in CT scans.42
Domain Adaptation for Synchrotron Data: Crucially, CycleGAN has been explicitly used to bridge the domain gap between noisy, fast-acquisition synchrotron µCT images and higher-quality, long-scan µCT images of porous rocks.6 The goal was to enable the use of segmentation models trained on labeled long-scan data to be applied to the unlabeled synchrotron data. The CycleGAN transferred the "dynamic-style" (noisy appearance) of the synchrotron data onto the long-scan data. To further improve realism, common noise types (Gaussian, Poisson) were added to the domain-transferred images before using them to train segmentation CNNs.6 This demonstrates a precedent for using CycleGAN to handle domain shifts specifically related to synchrotron µCT data characteristics.
4.3. Specific Relevance to Battery Electrode ImagingUnderstanding the 3D microstructure of battery electrodes is critical, as properties like porosity, tortuosity of ion pathways, active material particle morphology, connectivity, and the distribution of the carbon-binder domain (CBD) directly impact electrochemical performance, degradation mechanisms, and overall cell life.10µCT, both laboratory-based and synchrotron-based, is a key technique for characterizing these electrode microstructures non-destructively.7 Higher resolution techniques like X-ray nano-CT can resolve finer features like the CBD.45GANs are beginning to be applied in this specific area:
Microstructure Generation: GANs, including SliceGAN, have been used to generate realistic 3D virtual cathode microstructures that are statistically similar to experimental data.49 These synthetic structures can be used for computational modeling and virtual materials testing. Sometimes, physical constraints like target volume fractions of different phases are incorporated into the GAN training process to improve accuracy.49
While direct published examples of using GANs specifically for synthetic-to-real artifact simulation in synchrotron µCT of battery cathodes were not found in the provided snippets, the necessary components and related applications exist. GANs are proven tools for µCT data processing in materials science 6, for generating and analyzing battery microstructures 49, and for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in medical imaging and other fields.1 The successful use of CycleGAN for domain transfer of noisy synchrotron µCT data of porous rocks 6 provides a particularly strong indication that applying a similar approach to battery cathode data is plausible. The challenge lies in adapting and combining these existing capabilities to meet the specific requirements of simulating synchrotron artifacts while preserving the labeled structure of synthetic battery cathode data.The following table summarizes some key studies relevant to the user's problem:Table 2: Summary of Relevant GAN Application Studies

5. Feasibility and Implementation for Battery Cathode DataTranslating the conceptual framework of GAN-based synthetic-to-real adaptation into a practical implementation for synchrotron µCT data of NMC/argyrodite cathodes requires careful consideration of the training strategy, data specifics, and computational resources.5.1. Training Strategy: Unpaired LearningThe proposed approach relies fundamentally on unpaired training. The GAN model (e.g., CycleGAN with enhancements) will be trained using two distinct datasets:
Source Domain (X): The user's synthetically generated µCT volumes of battery cathodes. These images (x∈X) have associated ground-truth segmentation labels (l∈L).
Target Domain (Y): The real, lower-quality µCT volumes acquired at the synchrotron beamline. These images (y∈Y) are unlabeled.
Crucially, the segmentation labels L associated with the synthetic data X are not used during the training of the GAN itself (unless employed within a semantic consistency loss module, see Section 3.3). The GAN's objective is solely to learn the mapping GX→Y​ that transforms a synthetic image x into a realistic-looking image GX→Y​(x) that resembles images from domain Y, and the inverse mapping GY→X​.The ultimate goal is to use the output of the trained generator, the translated synthetic images GX→Y​(X), along with their original labels L, as the training data for the downstream segmentation network. The success of this strategy hinges on the GAN producing realistic translations GX→Y​(X) while preserving the structural correspondence with the original labels L.Regarding data quantity, while GANs can often learn from relatively limited data compared to supervised models requiring labels, achieving robust domain adaptation still benefits from representative datasets covering the variability within each domain. There's no fixed number, but typically dozens to hundreds of 2D slices, or multiple distinct 3D sub-volumes from both the synthetic generation process and real experiments, would be advisable to capture variations in microstructure and imaging conditions. The quality and characteristics of the real synchrotron data (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, type and severity of artifacts) will significantly influence the difficulty of the translation task and the amount of data needed.65.2. Data Considerations for NMC/Argyrodite SystemThe specific materials and imaging modality present unique considerations:
Material Contrast: NMC materials (containing transition metals) generally exhibit higher X-ray attenuation (appear brighter in absorption contrast) than the argyrodite solid electrolyte (a sulfide, Li6​PS5​Cl) and significantly higher than pores (darkest). The contrast differences between these phases are fundamental for segmentation. The GAN must learn to replicate the contrast levels and boundary appearances observed in the real synchrotron data, which might be affected by factors like beam energy, phase contrast effects 9, and detector response. Artifacts like beam hardening (intensity changes due to polychromatic X-rays) or scattering might manifest differently depending on the density and geometry of these phases.47
Feature Scale and Resolution: Effective segmentation requires resolving the key microstructural features: the morphology and size distribution of NMC particles, the contiguity and thickness of the argyrodite matrix, the pore network structure, and potentially finer details like intra-particle cracks or interfaces. The resolution of both the synthetic data generation process and the real synchrotron µCT acquisition must be sufficient to capture these features. Laboratory nano-CT can achieve resolutions around 63 nm 45, while synchrotron µCT can reach sub-micron resolutions.3 The GAN architecture (e.g., depth, receptive field size) must be chosen appropriately to handle the relevant feature scales without losing critical information during the translation.
Preprocessing: Consistent preprocessing is essential for stable GAN training. This typically involves:

Intensity Normalization: Rescaling voxel intensity values to a standard range (e.g., [-1, 1] or ).
Cropping/Patching: Training GANs on entire large 3D volumes is often computationally prohibitive. Common strategies involve training on 2D slices extracted from the volumes or on smaller 3D patches. 2D slice-based training is simpler but loses 3D context. 3D patch-based training preserves local 3D structure but requires more memory. A compromise is the 2.5D approach, where a small stack of adjacent 2D slices is used as input, providing some inter-slice context.29 The choice depends on computational resources and the importance of 3D context for the artifacts being simulated.


5.3. Computational ResourcesTraining GANs, especially on 3D data, is computationally demanding. It typically requires high-performance Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) with substantial memory (VRAM) to accommodate the network parameters and intermediate activations. Training times can be significant, potentially ranging from hours to days or even weeks, depending on the dataset size, the complexity of the chosen GAN architecture (including any auxiliary networks for semantic or perceptual losses), the patch/slice size, and the available hardware.25 Adequate computational infrastructure is a prerequisite for undertaking this approach.6. Evaluating GAN-Generated Realistic Tomography DataEvaluating the output of the GAN – the synthetic µCT images translated to look like real synchrotron data – is a critical step. Success requires not only generating visually realistic images but also ensuring they are suitable for the downstream segmentation task and have preserved the original structure accurately. Evaluation should encompass multiple perspectives.6.1. Visual Realism Assessment
Qualitative Inspection: The most intuitive evaluation involves visually examining the translated synthetic images (GSynth→Real​(x)).28 Domain experts (researchers familiar with synchrotron µCT of battery materials) should assess whether the translated images plausibly resemble the real synchrotron data. Key questions include: Do they exhibit the characteristic noise patterns? Are typical artifacts (e.g., subtle rings, streaks, phase contrast fringes, beam hardening effects) present and realistically rendered? Do the contrast and intensity distributions match the real data? Are there any obvious unrealistic textures or structures introduced by the GAN?
Comparative Viewing: Side-by-side comparisons of original synthetic images, translated synthetic images, and real synchrotron images are essential for judging the effectiveness of the translation.
Turing Tests: A more formal qualitative approach involves presenting experts with a mix of real images and translated synthetic images and asking them to distinguish between them.28 High confusion rates suggest the GAN is producing highly realistic outputs.
6.2. Quantitative Image Quality MetricsWhile visual assessment is crucial, quantitative metrics can provide objective measures of similarity, although they must be interpreted carefully.
Pixel-level Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are commonly reported.23 These measure average pixel-wise differences. However, in domain adaptation, low pixel error is not necessarily the goal; the translation should introduce differences (artifacts, noise) to match the target domain. These metrics are more useful for tasks like denoising or reconstruction where a clean ground truth exists, but less informative for judging the realism of generated artifacts.
Structural Metrics: The Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compares images based on perceived structure, luminance, and contrast.23 It is generally considered more aligned with human perception of similarity than pixel-level metrics and is more sensitive to structural changes. High SSIM between translated synthetic images and real images might indicate good structural alignment, but could also penalize realistic artifact generation if it alters local structure.
Distributional Metrics: The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is widely used for evaluating GANs.39 It measures the distance between the distributions of high-level features (extracted using a pre-trained network like Inception) from sets of real and generated images. A lower FID indicates greater similarity between the distributions, suggesting the GAN is capturing the overall characteristics of the target domain. However, FID has limitations: it doesn't guarantee sample quality or semantic correctness, can be sensitive to outliers, and good scores can sometimes be achieved by mode collapse or strategic sample selection.25 It provides a measure of distributional similarity but not necessarily structural fidelity at the individual image level.
It is critical to recognize that no single quantitative metric perfectly captures the dual requirements of realism (including artifacts) and structural preservation. Low FID or high PSNR/SSIM does not guarantee that the correct types of artifacts are present or that subtle structural details crucial for segmentation have been maintained. Therefore, these metrics should be used as complementary indicators alongside qualitative and task-based evaluations.6.3. Task-Based Evaluation: Impact on SegmentationThe most definitive evaluation of the GAN's success, given the project's objective, is to measure its impact on the downstream segmentation task.21 This involves:
Training Multiple Segmentation Models: Train an identical segmentation network architecture (e.g., a standard U-Net) on different datasets:

Model A: Trained only on the original synthetic data (X) with labels (L).
Model B: Trained only on the GAN-translated synthetic data (GSynth→Real​(X)) with the original labels (L).
(Optional) Model C: Trained on a combination or further augmentation of the translated data.


Evaluating on Real Data: Evaluate the performance of each trained segmentation model (Model A, Model B, etc.) on a held-out test set of real synchrotron µCT data. This real test set requires manual segmentation (even if laborious and limited in size) to serve as the ground truth for this evaluation phase.
Comparing Performance: Use standard segmentation metrics like the Dice coefficient, Intersection over Union (IoU or Jaccard index), precision, and recall to compare the performance of Model B against Model A on the real test data.1
A significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (e.g., higher Dice/IoU) for Model B compared to Model A provides strong evidence that the GAN-based domain adaptation was successful. It indicates the GAN effectively bridged the domain gap by introducing relevant real-world characteristics and crucially preserved the structural information necessary for the segmentation network to learn generalizable features from the original labels. Conversely, if Model B performs similarly to or worse than Model A, it suggests the GAN failed either in generating realistic enough features or, more critically, distorted the underlying structure, rendering the labels less useful. Many studies leverage downstream task performance as the ultimate validation for image generation or domain adaptation techniques.16.4. Assessing Preservation of Underlying StructuresDirectly assessing the structural fidelity with respect to the labels after translation is challenging but important:
Label Overlay and Visual Inspection: Overlay the original synthetic segmentation labels (L) onto the corresponding translated synthetic images (GSynth→Real​(X)). Carefully inspect boundaries between different material phases (NMC/argyrodite, particle/pore). Look for obvious misalignments, shifts, or areas where the translated image texture clearly contradicts the overlaid label.
Geometric Property Comparison: Calculate geometric or morphological statistics from the labeled regions before and after translation. For example, compare the volume fraction, surface area, particle size distribution, or centroid locations of NMC particles derived from the labels L applied to the original synthetic images X versus the same labels L applied to the translated images GSynth→Real​(X). Significant deviations in these statistics would indicate structural distortion introduced by the GAN. This provides a quantitative check on structural preservation beyond visual inspection.
7. Potential Challenges and LimitationsWhile GAN-based synthetic-to-real adaptation offers significant potential, the approach is not without substantial challenges and limitations that must be anticipated.7.1. GAN Training InstabilityGAN training is notoriously difficult and unstable.25 Common issues include:
Mode Collapse: The generator learns to produce only a very limited variety of outputs, failing to capture the diversity of the target domain (e.g., generating only one type of artifact or texture).49
Convergence Issues: The adversarial training process may fail to converge, with oscillations in loss values or divergence.
Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: Can hinder effective learning in deep networks.
Mitigating these issues often requires careful hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rates for generator and discriminator, weights for different loss components), selection of appropriate network architectures (e.g., deep residual networks, U-Nets are common for generators 21), use of robust loss functions (e.g., Wasserstein GAN loss instead of standard binary cross-entropy), and application of regularization techniques (e.g., gradient penalty, spectral normalization). Significant experimentation is often required to achieve stable training.257.2. Artifact Generation and Structural DistortionThere is a delicate balance between generating realistic artifacts and preserving the underlying structure.
Unrealistic Artifacts: The GAN might learn spurious correlations or fail to capture the true physics of artifact formation, leading to the generation of artifacts that do not exist in the real synchrotron data or an unrealistic exaggeration of existing ones.12 This could potentially confuse the downstream segmentation network.
Content/Structural Distortion: More critically for this application, the translation process might inadvertently alter the geometry of the features being translated.12 This could involve changing the size or shape of NMC particles, shifting their positions, altering the pore network connectivity, or blurring interfaces. CycleGAN, despite the cycle-consistency loss, can struggle with transformations involving geometric changes or removal/addition of objects, especially if the domains are significantly different.12 Any such distortion risks invalidating the original segmentation labels. The fidelity preservation techniques discussed in Section 3 are crucial for minimizing this risk, but their effectiveness needs empirical validation.
7.3. Impact on Label Accuracy and Spatial FidelityEven if major structural distortions are avoided, subtle issues can arise:
Boundary Shifts: The GAN might slightly alter pixel intensities near the boundaries between material phases. While the overall shape might be preserved, these subtle shifts could make the precise boundary location ambiguous or inconsistent with the original sharp label boundary, potentially impacting segmentation accuracy at interfaces.
Loss of Fine Details: The generation process might smooth out or fail to translate fine textural details within particles or the matrix that could be important cues for the segmentation network.23
Defining Fidelity: The core challenge lies in defining "spatial fidelity." If it means preserving the exact voxel-level segmentation map, this might be overly restrictive and conflict with the goal of changing the image appearance. A more practical definition is preserving the segmentability of the structures – ensuring that the same objects (particles, matrix, pores) remain identifiable and accurately separable by a downstream model, even if their appearance has changed. This highlights the importance of semantic consistency losses 26 that operate at a higher level than raw pixels, and underscores why task-based evaluation (Section 6.3) is paramount.
7.4. Validation DifficultiesEvaluating the success of the GAN translation is inherently difficult due to the unpaired nature of the data.
Lack of Ground Truth: There is no "correct" translated image for any given synthetic input, making direct quantitative comparison challenging.28 Assessing the realism of generated artifacts relies heavily on expert judgment.
Subjectivity: Visual assessment of realism is inherently subjective and can vary between experts.
Metric Limitations: As discussed (Section 6.2), standard quantitative metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and FID have limitations in this context and do not provide a complete picture of both realism and fidelity.25
7.5. Computational Cost and Data NeedsTraining complex GAN models, especially with additional loss terms or auxiliary networks, requires significant computational resources (GPUs, memory) and time.25 Furthermore, the GAN needs sufficient and representative data from both the synthetic and real domains to learn the complex mapping effectively. Data scarcity, particularly of diverse real synchrotron data, can pose a challenge.258. Alternative and Complementary ApproachesGiven the challenges associated with GAN-based domain adaptation, particularly regarding structural fidelity, it is prudent to consider alternative or complementary strategies for bridging the synthetic-to-real domain gap for segmentation model training.8.1. Physics-Based Artifact SimulationInstead of relying on a data-driven approach like GANs to learn artifact generation, one could attempt to explicitly model the physical processes underlying image formation and artifact generation in the synchrotron µCT setup. This involves simulating:
The X-ray beam characteristics (energy spectrum, coherence).
X-ray interaction with the material (attenuation, phase shift).
Detector physics (response function, noise characteristics).
Geometric factors (source-sample-detector distances).
Specific artifact sources (e.g., beam hardening due to polychromaticity, scattering, phase contrast effects, potential sample motion or drift).
This physics-based forward model could then be applied to the clean synthetic µCT data to generate realistic-looking images with simulated artifacts. Ray-casting was used as an initial step before CycleGAN in one medical imaging study 16, and physics-informed neural networks are being explored for tomographic reconstruction.5
Pros: This approach offers greater interpretability and control, as the artifact generation process is based on physical principles. It might allow for targeted simulation of specific known artifacts.
Cons: Accurately modeling the complex physics of a synchrotron beamline and detector system can be extremely challenging and may require detailed proprietary information about the setup. The model might still fail to capture all subtle real-world effects or stochastic variations. Developing such a model can be as complex, if not more so, than training a GAN.
8.2. Domain Randomization (DR)Domain Randomization offers a fundamentally different strategy. Instead of trying to make the synthetic data look exactly like the real data, DR focuses on making the segmentation model robust to variations between domains.13 This is achieved by heavily augmenting the synthetic training data with a wide range of random perturbations during the segmentation model's training phase. These perturbations can include:
Noise (Gaussian, Poisson, salt-and-pepper).
Blurring (Gaussian, motion).
Contrast, brightness, and gamma adjustments.
Geometric distortions (elastic deformations, rotations, scaling).
Simulated artifacts (e.g., adding random streaks or intensity gradients).
Texture randomization.14
The core idea is to expose the segmentation model to such vast and diverse variations during training that the real synchrotron data simply appears as another variation within the randomized distribution it has already learned to handle.13 The model learns to focus on domain-invariant structural features rather than relying on specific textures or intensity profiles that might vary between domains.
Pros: DR directly targets the robustness and generalization capability of the segmentation model. It avoids the need to train a separate, potentially complex and unstable, GAN for image translation. If the randomization range successfully encompasses the characteristics of the real domain, DR can be highly effective for sim-to-real transfer.13 It has been successfully applied in transferring models trained on synthetic X-ray data (DRRs) to real clinical X-rays.13
Cons: Designing the appropriate range and types of randomizations requires careful consideration and potentially some domain knowledge about the expected variations. Applying extensive augmentations can significantly increase the computational cost of training the segmentation model. DR does not necessarily produce visually realistic synthetic images if that is a separate goal.
Given the primary objective is to improve segmentation performance on real data, and considering the inherent challenges in guaranteeing structural fidelity with GANs, Domain Randomization presents a compelling and potentially simpler alternative strategy that directly addresses model robustness.8.3. Other Domain Adaptation Techniques (Feature Alignment)Another class of domain adaptation techniques operates by aligning the distributions of features extracted by the segmentation network, rather than aligning the images at the pixel level.11 These methods aim to learn domain-invariant feature representations, such that the features extracted from synthetic images and real images occupy similar regions in the latent space.Common strategies include:

Adversarial Feature Alignment: Training a domain discriminator on the features extracted by the segmentation network's encoder. The encoder is then trained to produce features that fool this discriminator, thereby encouraging domain-invariant features.61


Discrepancy Metric Minimization: Explicitly minimizing a statistical distance metric (e.g., Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), correlation distance, Wasserstein distance) between the feature distributions of the source and target domains.59


Prototype Alignment: Aligning class centroids or prototypes in the feature space across domains, often using pseudo-labels generated for the target domain.59


Other Approaches: Methods based on graph spectral alignment 58 or curriculum learning (progressively adapting from easy to hard samples) 59 have also been proposed.


Pros: Feature alignment directly targets the learning of domain-invariant representations within the segmentation model itself. It can be effective in mitigating domain shift without altering the input images. Some methods can be combined with image-level adaptation for potentially stronger results.61


Cons: These methods typically require access to unlabeled target domain data during the training of the segmentation network. Aligning distributions in feature space does not guarantee correct classification or segmentation, as class boundaries might still be misaligned. Implementation can be complex, involving adversarial training or careful calculation of distribution distances.

Feature alignment represents another alternative to GAN-based image translation, focusing adaptation efforts within the segmentation model's feature space.9. Recommendations and Conclusion9.1. Feasibility SummaryThe use of unpaired Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), such as CycleGAN and its enhanced variants, for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation of synchrotron X-ray microtomography (µCT) data of solid-state battery cathodes is deemed theoretically feasible and conceptually sound. This conclusion is supported by extensive research demonstrating the success of similar techniques in medical image synthesis (e.g., CT/MRI translation) 16, materials science µCT processing 6, and general simulation-to-reality bridging.1 The approach directly addresses the need for unpaired methods when perfectly corresponding real and synthetic data are unavailable.However, the feasibility in practice is contingent upon overcoming a critical challenge: robustly preserving the spatial and structural fidelity of the synthetic data to maintain the validity of the associated segmentation labels, while simultaneously introducing realistic artifacts and noise characteristics from the target synchrotron domain. Achieving this balance is non-trivial, and success is not guaranteed. It requires careful selection of methods, meticulous implementation, and rigorous evaluation.9.2. Recommended GAN ApproachBased on the analysis of current techniques and the specific requirements of the task, the following GAN-based approach is recommended:
Baseline Architecture: Start with a well-established CycleGAN framework.19 Employ U-Net based architectures for the generator networks, as they are known to perform well in image segmentation and translation tasks requiring preservation of spatial information.21
Essential Fidelity Enhancements: Do not rely solely on the basic cycle-consistency loss. Critically incorporate advanced techniques specifically aimed at structural and semantic preservation:

Strong Recommendation: Semantic Consistency Loss.16 This directly addresses the core requirement of maintaining label validity by penalizing changes in semantic content. Implementation will require using an auxiliary segmentation network (which could potentially be pre-trained on the synthetic data itself) to compare semantic maps or features before and after translation.
Recommended Addition: Perceptual Loss.29 This complements semantic consistency by encouraging better visual quality and preservation of fine structures and textures, using features from a pre-trained network like VGG or the GAN's discriminator.


Optional Regularization: Consider experimenting with Identity Loss 33 or SSIM Loss 32 as additional regularizers to further stabilize training and encourage structural similarity, potentially weighted lower than the primary semantic and perceptual losses.
Training Data Format: Begin training using 2D slices extracted from the 3D volumes or potentially 2.5D patches (small stacks of slices) 29 to manage computational load. If resources permit and 3D context proves crucial for artifact simulation, transition to training on 3D patches.
9.3. Evaluation StrategyA multi-faceted evaluation strategy is essential, with a clear focus on the ultimate goal:
Prioritize Task-Based Evaluation: The primary metric for success must be the improvement in segmentation performance (measured by Dice coefficient, IoU, etc.) on a held-out test set of real synchrotron data.21 Compare a segmentation model trained on GAN-refined synthetic data against one trained on the original synthetic data. This directly assesses whether the domain adaptation effort translated into tangible benefits for the end application.
Combine with Qualitative Assessment: Conduct thorough visual inspection of the translated images.28 Assess the realism of generated artifacts and, critically, look for any signs of structural distortion. Overlaying the original labels onto translated images is crucial for visually checking alignment and identifying potential inconsistencies at phase boundaries.
Use Quantitative Metrics Cautiously: Track image similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR) and distributional metrics (FID) during development and training.23 However, interpret these numbers with caution, recognizing their limitations 25, and always correlate them with qualitative and task-based results. They should be seen as diagnostic tools rather than definitive measures of success for this specific task.
9.4. Addressing Potential Challenges
Experimentation: Be prepared for significant experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, particularly concerning the relative weights of the different loss functions (adversarial, cycle-consistency, semantic, perceptual, identity, SSIM).27
Iterative Development: Start with simpler models and smaller data subsets to establish a working baseline before increasing complexity.
Monitoring: Closely monitor training dynamics (loss curves, generated image samples) to detect instability, mode collapse, or convergence issues early.
Flexibility: Be prepared to iterate on the architecture or combination of loss functions if initial attempts fail to yield satisfactory results in terms of both realism and fidelity.
9.5. Consider AlternativesIf the GAN-based approach proves overly complex, unstable, or fails to adequately preserve structural fidelity despite incorporating advanced techniques, alternative strategies should be strongly considered:
Primary Alternative: Domain Randomization (DR).13 This approach directly targets segmentation model robustness by heavily augmenting the synthetic training data. It avoids the complexities and potential fidelity issues of GAN training and may offer a more direct path to improving segmentation performance on real data. Significant effort would shift from training the GAN to designing an effective randomization strategy.
Secondary Alternative: Feature Alignment Methods.54 These techniques adapt the segmentation model's feature space rather than the images themselves. While potentially effective, they can also be complex to implement and require access to real data during segmentation training.
9.6. Concluding RemarksEmploying GANs for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation represents a promising strategy for leveraging labeled synthetic µCT data to train models capable of segmenting real, lower-quality synchrotron data of battery cathodes. The extensive work in related fields provides a solid foundation. However, the paramount importance of preserving structural and semantic fidelity to maintain label validity elevates this beyond a standard image style transfer task. Success hinges on the careful integration and tuning of advanced fidelity-preserving techniques, such as semantic consistency and perceptual losses, within the GAN framework. Rigorous evaluation, centered on the downstream segmentation performance, is non-negotiable for validating the approach. While technically demanding and requiring significant computational resources and expertise, the potential payoff—enabling accurate, automated segmentation of complex experimental data using readily available synthetic datasets—is substantial for accelerating research in battery materials and other scientific domains facing similar challenges. Should GANs prove intractable, Domain Randomization stands out as a highly viable alternative strategy.
